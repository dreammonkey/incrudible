## Development

Create a blank Laravel project in a folder next to this repo and add this entry to its composer.json file

```json
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "../incrudible"
        }
    ]
```

Now run `composer require dreammonkey/incrudible @dev`
